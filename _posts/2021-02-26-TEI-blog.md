#The TEI Expeirence

By: Brian Niemynski

Our class was all assigned to read The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. From there we were each assigned some pages from the short story to do some markup and evntually turn into a XML code. XML or eXtensible Markup Language allowed us to type up the pages in code and have them in an electronic form just like it was written in the story.
## Basic Markup in Google Docs
After reading the story and getting our assigned pages we got to work doing basic markup on the text. Some of the different things that I marked up on my pages were new paragraphs, underlined words, em-dashes, and weird spaces. I would like to think i got a very luck selection of pages because there wasn't too many things to mark up other than new paragraphs. When we were doing this in class, I thought this was a super pointless step. Well.... I was wrong. Doing this basic markup in class made the coding step super easy when it came time to do that.
