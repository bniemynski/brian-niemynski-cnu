# Getting To Know Brian

### My name is Brian Niemynski. My hometown is Fredericksburg Virginia. For those that have no clue where it is or have never heard of it, Fredericksburg is smack in-between Richmond and DC. I am an Economics major with a business administration minor. With this degree to come in the next year or so, I would like to move on and go and get my MBA. With an MBA I would possibly be a director of a hospital due to the fact that I am interested in the healthcare field, but I am nowhere close to being smart enough to become a medical student.

### I would never call myself a good writer in anyway. My mother questioned me on taking this class, but the reason that I am taking this class is not only for the WI requirement, but for the reason that i enjoyed my humanities class in high school and it combines that and current day technology. It sounded like a fun class and it requires the use of the greatest social media app, Twitter.

### The spring of my junior year my competitive basketball career had to end due to my health. I had suffered a cardiac arrest while playing in a basketball tournament. Laying lifeless on the floor I had been considered dead for about 15 minutes, but my coach was keeping me alive while doing cpr until someone found a defibrillator and shocked me twice to eventually bring me back. It was found that I had _Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy_, which is considered to be "the _Athlete Killer_", with only a *8%* chance for athletes to survive a cardiac arrest due to HCM. HCM is genetic, but I am the first one in my family to have it. Ever since having my cardiac arrest I have learned to look at life at different way. I have learned to never turn down an opportunity to have fun, because you'll never know when it will be taken from you.

### I am a part of a few on campus clubs and extracurricular activities here at school. First off, I am apart of Greek life. I am a brother of *Psi Upsilon* here on campus. Since I still have a place in my heart for basketball, I am on the club basketball team here at school. Usually we would either travel to or host other colleges and play a series of three games against them. Our good old friend covid has put that club season on pause for now. One last thing that I am very active in at school is intramurals. I have won multiple shirts while being here at school.
