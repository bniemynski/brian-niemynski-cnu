# Getting To Know Brian

My name is Brian Niemynski. I am a junior majoring in Economics with a minor in Business Administration.
I am from Fredericksburg Virginia. For those who don't know where that is, it is smack in the middle of Richmond and DC.
Some of the extra carricular activities that I am a part of at CNU is greeklife, intramurals, and club sports.
I am a brother of Psi Upsilon here at school. I play in alost every type of intramural sport here at schoola and have won multiple times. Last but not least, I am on the club basketball team here.
If there wasn't any covid still being a threat to us the blub basketball team would be still active and playing in tournaments with other schools.

That's really just a quick get to know me. I excited to see what we do in this class for the rest of the semester, and i am excitied to get to know the rest of the class!
