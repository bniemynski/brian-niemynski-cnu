*Charles Booth's London* is a Digital Humanities project centered around the history of the social and economic classes in the late 1980's in London. Charles Booth, a very well to do man put forth his free time into figuring out the social issues in his surrounding neighborhoods. While religion wasn't a huge part of his life, Booth just couldn't wrap his mind around the fact that some people are doing very poorly while he isn't. London's School of Economics and Political Science wanted to give their readers the chance to understand how even your neighbor right next door to you could be in a completely different class than you.

The project was user friendly on both a computer and a mobile device. Transitioning from notebook to notebook required no time at all. The virtual interactive map was easy to understand with the map legend. Different colors on the differnt streets pointed out the devides in the social/economic classes within the city. The maps also had the option to show the notebook pages and where exactly they were written before being collected.

Booth had collected notebooks from three different categories. These categories that he split his notebooks into were _Police Notebooks_, _Stepney Union Casebooks_, and _Jewish Notebooks_. Charles used these notebooks to help create his map of London and piece together the economic class of each street in every neighborhood.

London's School of Economics and Political Science was able to combine history from the late 1980's and current day technology into one digital humanities project. Everywhere you click the website always worked. There was no dead ends, which made it very easy to navigate. The poverty map was put together well and was able to be understood with all the different lines and colors across the whole map. The notebooks were organized nicely in a matter that they were in chronological order in which Booth had them. One area that I could see getting a little improvement is within the notebooks themselves. Some of the handwriting isn't that easy to read, therefore it's hard to understand what he was writing. Some of the notebooks have sentance long summaries, but maybe a whole translation of the pages within the notebook could help the reader understand where Booth was coming from. 

The project overall was put together very nicely and it was exciting to learn about. It educates the readers on the differnt social/economic classes within the city. Definately a good project to exlore if you ever get the chance.
