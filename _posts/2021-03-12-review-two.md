*Gulag Online - A Virtual Museum* is a digital humanities project developed by the Gulag.cz Assosiation focused on learning and imforming people abou the history of the soviet prison system, the Gulag. The Gulag is known in history to be a rough prison system that led many people to their eventual death. This project was created to give its viewers a visual representation on what these prisons might have been like back in the Soviet regime.

When you initially open this project you are greated by a map with a lot of red dots and a few pinpoint markers with different designs. You are also greated by a side panel with a basic desription of the project. On this side panel you can also see tabs at the top that are listed by home, people, places, items, and articles.

When you click on different parts of the map different information may pop up. If you click on the red dots, the information about the specicific prison comes up. Some of the information that pops up is the time of operation, the prsoner count within the specific years, and a link to a russian history page about that site. ANother thing that you can click on are the pinpoin markers that have different designs. One issue that one may run into is not knowing what the different markers mean. There is no key to know what each one means on the map itself. To figure out what each of them means you have to go to the tabs and click on places, thats where they are listed.

Within the different icons that you click on may give you additional information. Some of the icons that you click on will give you some articles on some of the survivors or even an in depth look at that gulag camp. If given info on the camp itself the reader may find some pictures or the remains of the camps. The developers were able to make the trip out to some of these camps and get a hands on experience of these camps and how the prisoners might have lived. The other information that may show up is the prisoner information. Within this information you can find their stories and even links to video interviews that they have done.

Another cool feature to this project is the 3D simulation you can walk through. This feature allows you to comtrol "yourself" as you walk through a 3D virtually rendered Gulag Camp. The developers took all of the pictures they ccaptured to create this camp to be as realistic as possible. One issue that the readers may run into for this simulation is that a computer with high RAM is required.
